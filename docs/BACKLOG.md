# Backlog

Future tasks and intentions for the TEMPO INS data explorer.

## UI / Navigation
- [x] add static pages - how do we treat translations?
- [ ] add 'last updated' page 
- [ ] Dataset page breadcrumbs: links click through but navigate to home instead of the correct category — needs investigation into how `/?code=` routing is handled on the landing page (explore-app.js) vs. direct URL navigation
- [ ] create a release log. how? backwards? 

## Misc
- [x] enhance table view
- [ ] more, nice themes - mai light a bit off-white, Financial Times, or Anthropic, lighter dark theme
- [x] add dataset code to explorer
- [x] add flags to language switcher
- [x] add disclaimer, not official gov.ro site
- [x] add data download option, csv/xlsx?
  - [ ] disseminate data. Kaggle, Hugging face? Check legal?
- [ ] should we split repos, data fetching, UI? - so we make a dataset independent SDMX UI framework?
- [ ] responsive
- [x] fetch newly updated datasets
  - [ ] continuous fetching, gh actions?
- [ ] Look for same EU stats?
- [ ] large datasets show no data: LOC108B — root cause: 0.4% fill rate (locality dimension has 3172 options × 43 counties × 7 categories × 23 years = theoretical 43M rows, actual 188k). Choropleth eligibility fixed (geo fallback). Remaining issue: needs REF_AREA_2 (locality) filtered before chart renders. Consider splitting into county-level vs locality-level sub-datasets.
- [x] detect ro/intl -> language. (`?lang=en` URL param)
- [ ] translate, Hu/De
- [ ] clean up obsolete subts, refactor scripts - utils, scripts?
- [ ] static site? - see `docs/misc-ideas/static-site/`
- [x] add llms.txt
- [ ] description, title, og:info should follow language

## Landing
- [x] Show latest updates
- [x] Flag interesting datasets
- [x] Some widgets per theme/subtheme/dataset

## misc
- [ ] sustainable development 2020 should be archived?

## Chart rules
- [ ] for long horizontal bar charts, prever vertical view
- [ ] bar charts, order by value
- [ ] if just 2 dimensions, don't give options to choose (axis, group), just to swap, transpose. 

## LLM Tooling — see plan `~/.claude/plans/peppy-fluttering-bubble.md`

Hybrid roadmap: minimal dev MCP → v1 user-facing agent → expand MCP → v2.
Architectural decision: tool-calling agent over existing safe services, **not** literal NL2SQL.
Shared substrate: extract `app/services/dataset_search.py` + `dataset_meta.py` once, reuse from MCP, agent, and existing routes.

### Step 1 — Minimal `tempo-dev` MCP (~2h) ✅
- [x] Refactor: extract `search_datasets()` and `get_dataset_meta()` from `app/routers/datasets.py` into `app/services/dataset_search.py` and `app/services/dataset_meta.py`. Keep route behaviour identical.
- [x] Write `tools/tempo-dev-mcp/server.py` (~150 lines, official `mcp` Python SDK) with 4 introspection tools: `tempo_dataset_info`, `tempo_search_datasets`, `tempo_chart_signature`, `tempo_sample`.
- [x] Add `.mcp.json` at repo root for repo-local registration.
- [x] Document in CLAUDE.md.

### Step 1.5 — MCP v2: query, catalog stats, FTS ✅
- [x] `tempo_query(matrix_code, filters?, group_by?, limit?)` — aggregated data queries via `build_data_query()`.
- [x] `tempo_catalog_stats(group_by?)` — corpus-level breakdowns by archetype/category/unit_type/geo/time_granularity.
- [x] `scripts/build-search-index.py` — FTS sidecar `data/corpus/search.duckdb` (14 MB, ~2s build). Bilingual search over names, 92k tags, definitions, categories.
- [x] `dataset_search.py` FTS-first strategy with LIKE fallback. "unemployment rate" → 130 results (was 0).
- [x] Full documentation in `tools/tempo-dev-mcp/README.md`.

### Step 2 — v1 user-facing NL→Data agent (~2.5h) ✅
- [x] `app/services/llm_client.py` — provider abstraction (Anthropic + OpenAI), normalised `LLMResponse`.
- [x] `app/services/agent.py` — tool registry, system prompt, `run_agent()` loop.
- [x] `app/routers/ask.py` — `POST /api/ask` behind `TEMPO_ASK_ENABLED` flag.
- [x] 4 agent tools: `search_datasets`, `get_dataset_schema`, `query_dataset_data`, `list_categories`. SQL never LLM-generated — calls `query_builder.build_data_query()` directly.
- [ ] Live end-to-end test with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (offline tool handlers verified; live LLM loop pending key).
- [ ] Minimal chat UI for `/api/ask` (currently only curl-testable).
- [x] **Agent: double-counting via unfiltered Total rows** — fixed via per-query parquet inspection. When the agent's `query_dataset_data` is called with `group_by`, `_detect_total_locks` scans each non-grouped, non-filtered dim for a `Total` value (`LOWER(TRIM(col))='total'`). If found, the handler locks those dims to Total and warns `Auto-applied Total filters: …`. If locking returns 0 rows (non-cross-product marginals like `TFP0512`), it falls back to the unfiltered SUM and warns `POSSIBLE DOUBLE-COUNTING: …` with an explicit re-query suggestion. Verified on `FOM104G`: buggy 28.25M → correct 5.36M for 2023. POP107D unchanged (parquet was pre-stripped). System prompt updated to teach the LLM how to read both warnings.
  - [ ] Follow-up: tighten the `query_dataset_data` 0-rows-strip-Total fallback so it doesn't undermine an explicit Total filter when the parquet truly has no cross-product cell (TFP0512 case). Currently the fallback strips Total filters even when Total exists in the parquet, returning the buggy unfiltered SUM. Fix: only strip a dim's Total filter if the parquet has no Total value for that dim.
- [ ] Pin `anthropic>=0.40` in `requirements.txt` (SDK 0.89.0 installed in dev venv but not pinned).

### Step 3 — Expand the dev MCP (~3–4h, after Step 2 surfaces real friction)
- [x] Pipeline state introspection: `tempo_pipeline_status`, `tempo_dataset_lineage`, `tempo_outdated`.
- [x] Code introspection: `tempo_routes`, `tempo_call_endpoint` (FastAPI TestClient).
- [ ] Eval: `tempo_eval_chart_selector` (diff vs baseline), `tempo_eval_agent` (YAML question set), `tempo_check_view_profiles`.
- [ ] Frontend probing (Playwright): `tempo_render_dataset`, `tempo_console_errors`, `tempo_validate_echarts_spec`.
- [ ] Gated mutations (`TEMPO_DEV_MUTATIONS=true`): `tempo_run_pipeline_script`, `tempo_regen_view_profile`, `tempo_clear_search_index`.
- [ ] Eval baselines: `data/eval/chart_selector_baseline.json`, `data/eval/agent_questions.yaml`.

### Step 4 — v2+ user features (varies)
- [ ] Cross-dataset reasoning: `compute_ratio` / `query_two_datasets` tool (joins on shared SDMX dims).
- [ ] Derived metrics tool: expose `dataset_trends` table as `get_trend_summary(matrix_code)`.
- [ ] Multi-turn drill-down with session memory.
- [ ] Hybrid retrieval: lexical FTS + multilingual embeddings (BGE-M3 / multilingual-e5-large).
- [ ] Streaming + chat panel UI.
- [ ] Methodology Q&A (RAG over `matrices.definitie` + `matrices.metodologie`).
- [ ] Statistical narrative generation (auto-explanatory journalism over INS data).
- [ ] LLM-driven chart customisation (override `chart_selector` defaults).
- [ ] Auto-generated periodic reports (Markdown/PDF/HTML).
- [ ] (See plan file Tier 2-4 for ambitious / research-grade ideas.)

## SDMX / Multi-Source

- [ ] **Phase 5: NL2SQL preparation** — Generate per-dataset JSON schema files, create DuckDB views for all parquet-v3 files, build corpus description for LLM context. *(Superseded by the LLM Tooling plan above — tool-calling agent reuses existing services rather than per-dataset views.)*

- [ ] **Phase 6: Multi-source adapter** — Eurostat/OECD data ingestion alongside INS data.
  Design `dataset_registry` table, build Eurostat SDMX-CSV adapter.

- [ ] **English parquet-v3 generation** — Run `12-parquet-to-sdmx.py --lang en` to
  produce English-language SDMX parquets. Requires English `sdmx_codes` entries
  (display_label_en already partially populated). *comment*: English data is the same data, we might only need to use the original Romanian ones and use the English metas.

- [x] **Clean up stale split profile files** — Done.
  Moved 1,150 stale profiles to `_stale/`: 736 parent profiles (parquets replaced by children),
  414 with `_nom_id` column refs. Fixed `dim_column_name` in DuckDB for 414 v2 splits
  (old `_nom_id` → SDMX names like `TIME_PERIOD`, `REF_AREA`). Regenerated 414 view profiles.
  Script: `scripts/cleanup-view-profiles.py`.

## Data Pipeline

- [ ] **"Actualizate recent" shows only ~8 of 220 2026-updated datasets**
  `sync_ultima_actualizare()` reads `ultimaActualizare` from metadata JSONs, but those fields
  are often stale — e.g. LCI101I news date is 2026-03-06 but its JSON says `02-09-2025`.
  **First investigate**: check whether the actual data in the parquet/CSV for LCI101I contains
  2026 observations, or whether INS is announcing an update but the data itself hasn't changed.
  If data IS updated (new rows in parquet), the metadata JSON field `ultimaActualizare` at
  the INS API level is simply not being refreshed promptly — aggravating but fixable by
  syncing dates from `insse_news.csv` instead of the metadata JSON.
  **Proposed fix**: replace `sync_ultima_actualizare()` with `sync_from_news()` that reads
  announcement dates directly from `insse_news.csv` and updates DuckDB for all news entries,
  not just the processed ones. Add `--sync-dates-only` flag for standalone runs.


- [ ] **Fix `10-import-metadata.py` — schema mismatch on `lang` column**
  Fails with `Binder Error: Table "contexts" does not have a column with name "lang"`.
  The script was written for an older schema where `contexts` and `matrices` had a `lang`
  column to store per-language rows. The current schema uses a single-row-per-entity
  approach with bilingual columns instead (`context_name_en`, `matrix_name_en`,
  `definitie_en`, etc.). The script needs to be updated to:
  1. Remove `lang` from `INSERT INTO contexts` / `INSERT INTO matrices` (and the `ON CONFLICT` key)
  2. Replace `WHERE lang = ?` filters with no-lang equivalents
  3. Map English fields to the `_en` columns rather than separate rows
  This runs in the post-matrix global rebuild step of `update-pipeline.py` (after all
  per-matrix steps succeed), so it's non-blocking for individual matrix updates but
  prevents the metadata index from being refreshed after bulk runs.


- [ ] **Replicate geo_hierarchy split for English (`eng`) parquet files**
  Pattern F splits are done on `ro` only. Since `nom_item_id` values are shared across
  languages, the same ID sets detected from `ro` can be reused. Low effort once the ro
  run is stable.

- [ ] **Handle `Municipii si orase` (4 datasets) — Pattern G**
  321 values mixing municipalities and towns in a single dimension. Potential split:
  `_municipii` and `_orase`. Affects: AGR*, TLC* and others.

- [ ] **`Macroregiuni si regiuni de dezvoltare` (60 datasets)**
  2-level variant of geo_hierarchy (no counties). Already handled by Pattern F
  (emits `_regiuni` + `_macroregiuni`), but worth verifying output quality separately.

## Static Site Migration

- [ ] **Phase 2: DuckDB-WASM data client** — Test `duckdb-data-client.js` against real
  parquet files, verify HTTP range requests work with CORS, compare output with
  FastAPI `/data` endpoint. Handle edge cases (missing parquet, WASM not supported).

- [ ] **Phase 3: Port frontend components** — Copy/adapt `explorer/static/js/` chart
  modules and Vue components to `static-site/js/`. Wire up to `api-static.js`.
  Main files: `DatasetPicker.js`, `ChartCanvas.js`, `FilterBar.js`, `LeftSidebar.js`.

- [ ] **Phase 4: Deploy pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow: run `build-static-site.py`,
  upload JSON to Cloudflare Pages, upload parquet to R2. Service Worker for offline caching.

- [ ] **Phase 5: Retire FastAPI app** — Archive `app/`, `duckdb-browser.py`, update CLAUDE.md.

- [ ] **Aggregation in DuckDB-WASM** — Port the GROUP BY aggregation fix (from backlog
  "Raw LIMIT truncation" issue) into `duckdb-data-client.js`. Easier in WASM since
  the full query builder is in JS.

## UI / App

- [x] **v2 UI build (Lens)** — Two-panel dashboard shipped: Trends (line/area/stacked over time) +
  Snapshot (grouped bar/heatmap/bubble/choropleth/bar for single period) with period navigator
  and play animation. Category browse, search, theme toggle, i18n all working.
  Remaining: data table, export, responsive polish, URL state.

- [x] **Choropleth: support region-level map** (`_regiuni` sub-datasets)
  Done — region + macroregion GeoJSON files generated, multi-level choropleth in chart-geo.js.

- [x] **Dataset page: show split siblings**
  Done — sub-dataset bar with pills in dataset-page-v2.js, variant drawer in datasets-page.js.

### Lens UI Improvements

- [ ] **URL state persistence** — persist filters, chart type, and selected period in URL. Also, language.
  so dashboard views are shareable/bookmarkable (e.g. `?code=POP301A&period=2020&snap=heatmap`).
  Currently only `?code=` is saved; filter/chart/period selections reset on reload.

- [x] **Data table toggle** — Done. Collapsible data table with dropdown column filters,
  zebra striping, sticky headers, filtered/total row count. Client-side filtering via
  exact match on dimension columns.

- [ ] **Visual polish pass** — x-axis label truncation on rotated labels, responsive
  breakpoints for mobile (category grid, insight cards, chart panels), smooth transitions
  between chart type switches.

- [x] **Export** — CSV/XLSX download of filtered data with language support.
- [ ] **Export** — PNG export of charts.

- [ ] **Add `lang` to `get_dataset()` endpoint** — dataset names in the dashboard header still
  show in Romanian when EN is selected. Add `lang` param, use `COALESCE(matrix_name_en, matrix_name)`.

- [ ] **Responsive mobile layout** — 3-column category grid and 4-column insight cards don't
  adapt well to phones. Add `@media (max-width: 768px)` breakpoints for stacking.

- [ ] **Monthly → yearly aggregation toggle** — For datasets with monthly data,
  add an option to aggregate values by year (SUM for counts, AVG for rates/indices).
  Useful for long time series (20+ years of monthly data = 240+ points) where
  yearly trends are easier to read.

- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts legend** — Lens supports `/`, `Cmd+K`, arrow keys but there's no
  discoverable way to learn about them beyond the search footer hints.

- [x] **Loading states for chart switching** — Done. Chart containers show loading state with
  opacity transitions during re-render.

- [x] **Dataset definition/methodology panel** — Done. Collapsible info panel below header
  shows definition, methodology, and notes from metadata.

- [x] **Category breadcrumbs** — Done. Clickable breadcrumb trail with nested subcategory
  drill-down (▸ rows), back button shows parent name. Stack-based navigation.

- [x] **Smarter large dataset handling** — Done. Auto-applies first non-TOTAL filter for
  datasets >50k rows. Shows amber warning banner. Retries on filter-required errors.

- [x] **Trend indicators on category cards** — Done. Green/red bar showing proportion of
  increasing vs decreasing datasets, plus avg YoY% growth. New `/api/categories/trends` endpoint
  aggregates `dataset_trends` via `UNNEST(ancestor_codes)`. Works for all context levels.

## Data Accuracy — Server-Side Aggregation

- [x] **Server-side GROUP BY for chart queries** — Done.
  Frontend sends `group_by` param with chart-relevant dimension columns. Backend
  `query_builder.py` generates `SELECT dims, SUM(OBS_VALUE) ... GROUP BY dims`.
  Table view sends raw queries (no GROUP BY). Typical reduction: 99%+ for large datasets
  (e.g., EXP102J: 18,225 → 168 rows). Files: `query_builder.py`, `dataset_data.py`,
  `api.js`, `dataset-page-v2.js`.

- [x] **Non-summable values** — Done.
  `query_builder.py` accepts `agg_func` param (SUM or AVG). `dataset_data.py` looks up
  `matrix_profiles.primary_unit_type` — uses AVG for `percentage` (694 datasets) and
  `time_unit` (12 datasets), SUM for everything else.

## Chart Selection — Future Improvements

- [ ] **Treemap chart type** — For hierarchical categorical data (CAEN economic sectors),
  treemap would show proportions better than horizontal bar. Requires frontend implementation.

- [ ] **Sparkline/KPI view** — Datasets with 1 dimension (pure time series, no categories)
  are perfect for a large KPI number + sparkline, not a full chart.

- [ ] **Ratio/change chart mode** — Year-over-year change, growth rates, indexed values.
  The trend data already detects these patterns; expose as an alternative view.

- [ ] **Radar chart** — For comparing a small number of categories across multiple
  metrics (e.g., county profiles across health/education/economy indicators).

- [ ] **Unify `generate_view_profiles.py` with `chart_selector.py`** — Both contain
  independent chart selection logic. The view profile generator has its own snapshot chart
  rules that partially overlap. Long-term, view profiles should call `select_charts()`.

- [ ] **Delete `app/services/chart_config.py`** — Dead code, no imports found. Kept for
  reference during the transition period but should be removed.

## Data Quality

- [x] **Phase 8: Strip aggregate/total rows from parquet files** — Done.
  49 parquet files stripped of 28,280 aggregate rows (Total in SEX, AGE, RESIDENCE, REF_AREA).
  Scripts: `scripts/detect-totals.py` (detection + decisions), `scripts/strip-totals-from-parquet.py`
  (apply to existing parquets), `12-parquet-to-sdmx.py --strip-totals` (integrated pipeline).
  Handles mutually exclusive breakdowns via intersection mode (only strips grand-total row).
  Decisions stored in `data/logs/total-decisions.json`.

- [ ] Review `docs/TODO_COMPACTION.md` — label normalisation issues in 7-data-compactor.py
